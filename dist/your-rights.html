Ask witnesses to record the arrest and clearly identify yourself: Your name, date of birth, and an emergency number to call. This information could be written on the wrist of your arm.</li class="first-item-1">
                            <li class="first-item-2">During an arrest, try to get witness information. Ask for their name, date of birth, and contact information–whether that be a phone number or an email address. Also, try to get information on the officer(s) at the scene: their badge(s), patrol car number(s), and agency.</li class="first-item-2">
                            <li class="first-item-3">During an arrest, you have the right to remain silent and the right to request for a lawyer. It’s best to remain silent and deny requests to sign papers without a lawyer. Anything could be used in favor or against your favor in this open case.</li class="first-item-3">
                            <li class="first-item-4">During your arrest, you have the right to make a local phone call. They may not listen to the conversation if you’ve chosen to dial your lawyer.</li class="first-item-4">
